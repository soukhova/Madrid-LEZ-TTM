Estimated using [{r5r}](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/), the centroids of a buildings from the Madrid Open Street Map (downloaded June-6-2024), the Madrid OSM road network (June-6-2024), and all available GTFS feeds (March-6-2024). What's included:

The all-buildings-to-all-buildings travel time matrices (car, transit, walk, bike): 
- On the unedited OSM road network and GTFS files,
- On the edited OSM road network (no cars allowed within Madrid Centro) and unedited GTFS files,
- On the edited OSM road network (no cars allowed within Madrid M30) and unedited GTFS files.

Heatmap of buildings (summarized by hexagons) and main roads:

### Editing the OSM .pbf file to exclude vehicle access:

Included in this repo are the unedited OSM road network "madrid-latest-osm.pbf", and two edited files "madrid-latest-osm-NoCentro.pbf" and "madrid-latest-osm-NoM30.pbf". All three are used to produce routing times for car mode. Routing times are produced for the other three modes using "madrid-latest-osm.pbf" -- as they are not impacted by the edits to the road network in "madrid-latest-osm-NoCentro.pbf" and "madrid-latest-osm-NoM30.pbf".

- Create a new copy of "madrid-latest-osm.pbf" file. Rename it to "madrid-latest-osm-NoCentro.pbf"

- Download [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)

- Install the "UtilsPlugin2" plugin, see here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins#Installation

- In JOSM open the "madrid-latest-osm-NoCentro.pbf" file and the "ZBE-Centro.shp" (retrieved from [Madrid datos abiertos](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=019f24aaef3d3610VgnVCM1000001d4a900aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default))

- In the layers panel, merge ZBE-Centro.shp and madrid-latest-osm-NoCentro.pbf, with madrid-latest-osm-NoCentro.pbf being the 'target' layer. Click Continue. 

- Zoom in and find the "ZBE-Centro.shp" within the newly merged file. It should have a Layer label with value "Madrid Central". You want to select it. You know you've selected it when the Membership panel looks like this:
![Madrid Central selection details 1](figures/howtosteps1.png)

- On the top dropdown bar, select "Selection" -> All inside [testing]. Now everything inside the merged ZBE-Centro.shp will be selected. The Membership panel should look like this:

![Madrid Central selection details 2](figures/howtosteps2.png)

- Click the edit button in the Selection panel. In the Change Value window that pops up, change the "motor_vehicle" key to the value "no" (see details about the [motor_vehicle OSM tag](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:motor_vehicle)). Click Overwrite. This step should look like this:
![Madrid Central selection details 3](figures/howtosteps3.png). 

- Confirm that you've modified the roads. Do so by clicking on a street that's been modified,  in the Membership panel you should now see a label for motor_vehicle with a value of no. You can also check a few streets outside the ZBE-Centro boundary, you'll see they likely do not have a motor_vehicle label, and if they do, it is likely not no. For the streets inside the zone, the Membership panel should look like this: 
![Madrid Central selection details 4](figures/howtosteps4.png).

- Now right click on the layer in the Layers panel, and save the .pbf file. You can overwrite the madrid-latest-osm-NoCentro.pbf file, as this is the new one!

- Repeat these steps using the "madrid-latest-osm-NoM30.pbf" and the "ZBE-M30.shp" (Javier created this, it is the area inside the M30 - so motor_vehicles are still allowed on the M30.

Now, we 3 osm.pbf files:

- madrid-latest-osm.pbf (original) - will be used to estimate "calc_cartt_nores.Rdata", "calc_transittt.Rdata", "calc_walktt.Rdata", "calc_bikett.Rdata". 
- madid-latest-noM30.osm.pbf (all motor vehicles are restricted within the M30 area)  - will be used to estimate "calc_cartt_noM30.Rdata"
- madid-latest-NoCentro.osm.pbf (all motor vehicles are restricted within the LEZ Centro)  - will be used to estimate "calc_cartt_noCentro.Rdata"

Additional check: I will try to route the "walk" travel times using the modified .pbf files. I expect them to yield the exact same travel times as the non modified .pbf file, while the car travel times should yield different results. This is what we want!
